     Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures?

markdown_help_text: |
      Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. Jenny has some enhancements, to make sure that
      saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

      - <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
      - <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
      - <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
      - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>,
      and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
      EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>

      - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram
      buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code>
      will be the url which is opened.
      EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

      If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
      <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
      [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
      This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

      Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!
